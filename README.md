**FAQs**
1. The extension is enabled but the page did not show a pop up that says "page accessibility ready"
This can happen at times due to transient network failures. However, every image that we add an accessibility descriptive text on has a green border added to it. See image below -

All four images are accessible and hence have a green background around them.
